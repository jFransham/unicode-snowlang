# Unicode Snowlang

Ever wanted to build a snowman? Well now you can!

_Unicode Snowlang_ is the first language that lets you build up to 30000 snowmen at once!

Not only that, but it is a great teaching tool for young programmers, reducing complex problems
into a language everyone can understand: snowmen. Unicode ones.

To build your snowmen, you specify how to create them to the _Unicode Snowlang_ interpreter with
the following language:

- ☃->☃ Move on to the next snowman
- ☃<-☃ Go back to the previous snowman
- ❄ Add some snow to the current snowman
- ☀ Melt the current snowman a little
- ☃? Ask for some information about the current snowman
- ☃! Tell the world about the current snowman
- unicode and snowman are keywords in _Unicode Snowlang_ that will only let the program continue when
	they are together (when the current snowman has completely melted)

Using this simple language it has been proven that any possible problem can be solved. This is
mathematically the most useful thing snowmen have ever done.

You use the interpreter like this: either specify a file with unicode-snowlang \[FILENAME\] or build
your snowmen directly from the terminal with unicode-snowlang \[-l|--lit|--literal\] \[command\]+.

_Unicode Snowlang_ files are specified with the file extension .frost. If your program is quite warm
I suggest you use a different extension.
